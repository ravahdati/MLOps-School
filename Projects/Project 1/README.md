# Breast Cancer Prediction Project

## Overview:
This project is a sample application that predicts breast cancer using a trained model. The project is implemented using Flask. To make a prediction, you first need to register on the website and log in. After logging in, you can go to the prediction page, fill in all the required input data, and submit it. The model will then make a prediction based on the provided data, and the result will be displayed on the results page. The model will indicate whether the given input data suggests a benign or malignant tumor.

## Features:
- **User Registration & Login**: New users must register, and existing users can log in to access the prediction page.
- **Data Input for Prediction**: Once logged in, users can input the necessary features (e.g., mean radius, texture, area) on the prediction form.
- **Model Prediction**: The model processes the input data and predicts whether the cancer is benign or malignant.
- **Result Display**: The prediction result is displayed on the result page, along with the provided input features.

## Demo Users:
You can use the following demo accounts to log in and test the application:

- **User 1**:
